A simulation for a preferred diet over a choice of four varying protein: carbohydrate ratios for different types of *drosophila melanogaster*.  

This simulation gives the mean average of how many flies prefer a particular diet over a series of repeat experiments and the preferred diet choice for: 

#### Mated female diet preference
#### Virgin female diet preference 

Over a choice of diets: 

__8:1, 2:1, 1:2, 1:8 and the choice of no diet (around the edge of an assay plate)__

This repository contains code which will give the mean average of a choice of 10 flies, across 10 replicates as well as what is the preferred diet choice. 
This also contains code which will give a proportional value of the diet in which flies will go to when given the choice.
